# subrouter

Go service for routing AI coding-agent traffic across subscription accounts and API keys.

## Development

- Use `go test ./...` before handing off changes.
- Keep credential handling read-only unless a command explicitly delegates to the upstream account manager, such as `cx`.
- Do not log access tokens, refresh tokens, API keys, request bodies, or complete Authorization headers.
- Prefer standard-library networking primitives unless a dependency removes meaningful complexity.
